# Progress Log - Claims Triage Agent

## 2026-07-30 - Phase 1: scaffold + ingestion + classifier + logging

- New repo, separate from ai-consulting-lab (deliberately - a second, focused
  repo reads cleaner for a portfolio than folders bolted onto the HVAC project)
- Built: config.py, db.py (raw_emails + agent_decisions tables), classifier.py
  (Claude tool-use call forcing structured JSON output), routes/ingestion.py
  (POST /inbound-email), app.py
- Reused conventions from ai-consulting-lab/PROJECT.md: X-API-Key header /
  APP_SECRET_KEY variable name, .env.example with names only (never real
  values), blueprint structure, mocked DB + mocked Claude calls in tests so
  the suite runs without real credentials
- Set PORT default to 5002 (5000 = macOS AirPlay, 5001 = the HVAC project) so
  both projects can run at the same time without a conflict
- 7 tests passing (health check, auth rejection, bad JSON, blank/placeholder
  field rejection, happy path decision + persistence)
- Not yet built: eval_labels/eval_runs tables, golden dataset, eval harness
  (Phase 3), dashboard (Phase 4), real Neon DB connection (still using a
  fake DATABASE_URL locally since tests mock the DB layer entirely)

**Next session:** stand up a real Neon database for this project, run
init_db() against it, and do a real end-to-end curl test with a real
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY against one of the sample_emails/*.json files.
